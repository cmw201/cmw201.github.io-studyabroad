<h2 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> About Me </h2>
<img src=./me.jpeg width=250 style= "float:right; margin-right:20px; margin-left: 15px"> <img> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> My name is Catherine Wynne. I am majoring in Microbiology with minors in Chemistry and Mediterranean Art & Archeology. I am also pursing a Conceptual Foundations of Medicine Certificate. From May 14 to June 17, 2023 I took part in the University of Pittsburgh's Comparative Healthcare in Graz study abroad program in Graz, Austria and Maribor, Slovenia. The program exposed me to many different perspectives on medicine and healthcare and cultural differences between the U.S. and Austria. I decided to partake in this program because I have a strong interest in public health. I was curious to see how countries with nationalized medicine systems have different approaches to healthcare as compared to the U.S. Over the course of this trip I learned about why Austria and the United States have the healthcare systems that they do. Each of the healthcare systems have aspects that work for their country and other parts that need improvement.

<h2 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Why Comparative Healthcare in Graz? </h2>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">I selected this program because I have a strong interest in public health and am intrigued by the approach that European countries take. I was particularly interested in learning about the impact that nationalized healthcare has on health outcomes and the accessibility of said care. I aim to obtain my master’s in public health after graduation. I chose this program, specifically, because I wanted to expand my knowledge of healthcare delivery systems and learn about well-being in other countries besides the U.S. I would like to enter graduate school with a broad perspective of healthcare systems.  This program has definitely helped to widen my scope of knowledge about healthcare delivery, outcomes, and values.</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Since this program was so immersive, I had the opportunity to learn a lot about Austrian culture and see first hand how their lifestyle contributes to their healthcare system. Austrians' preferred modes of transportation are walking or biking. Many people stay active into old age, which prevents some issues associated with aging. Their cities are very pedestrian-friendly and walkable. I noticed that the work-life balance is much better in Austria and people are not as stressed about their jobs. In the morning, I saw people taking their time at breakfast, going to cafes, and not being in a rush to get to work. </p>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Most notably, I learned about the social attitudes towards healthcare and the differences in perception about community. In Austria, their system reflects their close-knit communities and sense responsibility for others. Every Austrian citizen is able to see a doctor and receive quality medical care regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. While Austrians pay high taxes, they have the security of knowing that their hospitals stays, medications, and any accidents that may occur will not bankrupt them. In comparison, the United States has an every person for themselves approach which is reflected in the prevalence of private insurance. There have been trends towards the nationalized healthcare in the United States, with the creation of Medicare (1965), Medicaid (1965), CHIP (1997), and the Affordable Care Act (2010). The conversation about nationalized healthcare is a difficult one to have in the United States where we value personal freedom and ability to choose.</p>
<h2 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Why Should Someone Study Abroad + Potential Hurdles</h2>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> If you are looking to learn more about healthcare through a variety of different lenses or are looking to learn about a different culture in an immersive experience, then this program is for you. I think this program would greatly benefit anyone regardless of if you know what career you want to have or not. I learned so much on this trip that I will carry with me into whatever career I pursue. On this trip, I gained a greater appreciation for the challenges healthcare workers face, the problems Americans face in accessing healthcare, and learned about patient perspectives. This study abroad experience widened my scope of knowledge both academically and culturally. </p>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> A hurdle I faced while in Austria and Slovenia was adjusting to a different way of life. They are much more laid back in most regards, this means that many stores and restaurants close early. If you want to eat dinner, plan to eat earlier in the day. Another hurdle I faced was feeling overwhelmed because I did not understand the language and felt judged for speaking English. I overcame this by reminding myself that I was trying my best with the new language and practicing saying small things to build my confidence. The last hurdle I faced was always being on the go. Our days started very early and ended late in the evening on many days. When you feel that your days are packed and you are tired, remind yourself that you are on here for five weeks and this is a once in a lifetime experience. Our days are packed for a reason and in doing so I got to see so many amazing places and learn a lot! </p>

<h2 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Overview of Program and Main Takeaways </h2>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Comparative Healthcare in Graz is based in Graz, Austria. I spent four weeks in Graz studying the history of healthcare and medicine in both Austria and the United States. After a month in Graz, I relocated to Maribor, Slovenia to continue studying healthcare in other parts of the European Union. The purpose of the program is not to decide which country has the best healthcare system, rather to understand how history and type of societies inform the healthcare systems in place today. Both the European model and the United States model have advantages and disadvantages, but there are parts of each model that can be implemented to improve patient care and health outcomes. </p>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">To summarize the difference between the Austrian model and the U.S. model, I will refer to the history and culture of both countries. Austria and Slovenia are both tiny countries. Their communities are much smaller and closer-knit compared to the U.S. Due to this, an attitude developed that people and the government have a responsibility take care of people in their community. This attitude is reflected in their insurance policies and social welfare programs. In Austria and Slovenia, the citizens expect certain resources and services from state. Their attitude is very state-centered and centralized, as such individuals are prepared to sacrifice certain freedoms so that the state provides basic things for them. In the U.S., we have a much larger population and very individualistic approach. U.S. citizens value freedom and want to be able to choose their healthcare and doctors, rather than it being provided for them by the state.</p>
<h2 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Future Career Aspirations</h2>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> This program has made me more cognisant of barriers to healthcare delivery. I hope to be able to address some of these concerns in my future career in public health. Over the course of this program, I became more informed about challenges in healthcare delivery. In class, we talked about social determinants of health (SDOH) in America and how nonmedical factors such as race, location, sexuality, education, socioeconomic status, etc. impact healthcare outcomes. It was interesting to see that even in Austria and Slovenia, where insurance is provided by the state and there are not as many SODH due to a very homogenous population, there are still people who fall through the cracks and rely on social support programs, like Marienambulanz or Vinzidorf, for basic healthcare. In my future career, it is my hope to bring awareness to social determinants of health and try to mitigate them through education of medical professionals. </p>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> In class, we also talked about how the American healthcare system drives innovation. One of the most recent innovations is phage therapy, which uses bacteriophages to treat bacteria-resistant infections. I have first-hand experience with this experimental treatment, as I am working in the Van Tyne Lab in the Department of infectious Diseases in the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine this summer. At my job, I was reading "Considerations for the Use of Phage Therapy in Clinical Practice" by Suh et. al. and discovered that since phage therapy is not FDA approved, it is not reimbursable by insurance. The cost of phage therapy is expensive, even outside of the hospital, because self-administration requires extensive patient education on proper use and storage. In my job so far, I have seen how impactful phage therapy can be for some patients, but after this summer program I am even more aware of how inaccessible this therapy is for many people. One of my goals in my future career will be to make experimental therapies, such as phage therapy, accessible to everyone, not just those who have the means to pay out-of-pocket. America may be leading the way in innovation, but that does not mean much if these therapies are not available to the people who need them.<p>


<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">I would like to thank Prof. Orin James for his expertise and guidance within Austria and Slovenia. I learned a lot that will be applicable to my future career in the science and healthcare field. Thank you to the friends I made on this trip for the support and great memories!</p>
